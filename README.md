ðŸ“· About Project -  

ðŸš©   In this project we've build IoT based smart lock which have been accessed through RFID.  

ðŸš©   So now, if user want to unlock this lock, then he or she should have Valid RFID.  

ðŸš©   Also we have programmed this lock system to keep record data of user entries with user name and timestamp. This data will recorded on our dedicated my S.Q.L database which is hosted on our webserver, hence the system Administrator can login to that web portal and, keep track of how many time this lock got opened.
